Starting Session 04 readme.

Review of homework indicates there is a good opportunity here to update mailroom and the associated data storage types.  This should greatly simplify subsequent code.



DICTIONARIES
support in, not in operators
dict.get('key_value') returns location within dictionary
dict.pop('key_value') ==> returns value at key location and removes from dict
    (note similarity to list.pop(i))

setdefault(key, [value, default]) -- gets the value if present, sets default otherwise

sets are dictionaries with only keys, no associated values, construct w/{}

sets are mutable, there is an immutable variety called 'frozenset' syntax is same
